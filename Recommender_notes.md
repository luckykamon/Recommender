### Recommender

This code first loads the data from the pickle file and then creates a pivot table with
the client ID as the rows, product ID as the columns and the purchase count as the values.
Then it replaces the missing values with 0. Then it creates an instance of the TruncatedSVD
class with the number of components set to 100. Then it fits and transforms the pivot table 
into a matrix of latent features. The client_index_mapping is then used to map the client ID 
to the corresponding index in the transformed matrix. The client's vector is then retrieved 
from the transformed matrix and dot product is taken with all other rows. The index of the
most similar client is then found and the most similar client's purchase history is retrieved. 
Finally, the items that the most similar client has purchased but the specific client 
has not are recommended.

It is important to note that this is just one example of how you could use SVD to make 
recommendations, and that there are many other algorithms, techniques, and considerations 
to take into account when building a recommender system, depending on the specifics of your
use case and the data you have.
